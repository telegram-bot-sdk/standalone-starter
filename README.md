## Webhook Setup

> **IMPORTANT:** Telegram requires your domain to have an SSL certificate (https) to setup a webhook.

Open `.env` and fill your domain:

```
TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_DOMAIN=www.yourdomain.com
```

The standalone starter comes with a CLI helper to setup webhook for your bot. Simply fire the below command.

```bash
php telegram webhook:setup <botname>
```

This will setup your bot's webhook to this URL:

```
https://<www.yourdomain.com>/webhook.php?token=YourBotToken&bot=YourBotName
```

The webhook file will verify any inbound requests to make sure its a valid request from Telegram.
It'll deny any other requests. So you need not have to worry.

You can process inbound updates either using an event listener or directly in the given `bot/Http/WebhookController.php` in `listenForUpdate()` method.
